# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for the annual Advent of Code exercises.

Don't read too much into this. I'm putting this up online as a way to share
with friends. The solutions are often written to get to the answer in a short
amount of time, not necessarily a good sample of my work in general.

I may try to refine some of the solutions if I find the probelm interesting.
If this happens you will see changes in the revision history.
